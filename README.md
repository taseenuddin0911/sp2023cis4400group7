# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help people decide where the best place to rent an apartment in NYC based on 311 complaints. The complaint types we focused on were
based around the living area and conditions ranging from parking complaints, to noise complaints and some building code violations. The way someone would choose
the best place to live would be based on their own preferences on what they don't mind dealing with. The data we worked with don't take into account living
expenses.
